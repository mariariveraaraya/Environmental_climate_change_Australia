This scarcity has constrained the development and understanding of climate and environmental change in the Australians tropics, and thereby the ability to provide context for the long period of human occupation of the region. Lake sediment archives are widely used to recognize changes in climate, precipitation and anthropogenic activities with the potential to significantly extend the length of available observational record by many millennia. Despite the common use of lake sediment proxy indicators to reconstruct climate and environmental histories, existing research demonstrates the complications associated with building robust and accurate chronologies, and interpreting the meaning of observed changes observed from multiple physical, biological and chemical sources of information. This study was based upon a 1.72 m sediment core from Sanamere Lagoon (11.123°S 142.359°E) with the aim to develop a new record of climate and environmental change for northern Cape York Peninsula. The record spans the last ~33 thousand calibrated years before the present (ka), based on a robust chronology established by comparing age-models derived from multiple carbon fractions (pyrogenic carbon derived from hydrogen pyrolysis -hypy fraction-, macrocharcoal, microcharcoal, pollen concentrate, bulk sediment and cellulose). The age-depth model derived from the hypy fraction was the most reliable and consistent with the stratigraphic changes identified along the core, removing allochthonous carbon and postdepositional contamination. This chronology provided the base for the climatic and environmental reconstructions from the Sanamere sediment core presented in this thesis. Time series based on diatoms, phytoliths, hypy fractions, stable isotopes and elemental geochemistry (ITRAX micro X-ray fluorescence scanning) were used to understand the evolution of environmental conditions in the area surrounding Sanamere Lagoon. Four main periods of environmental change were identified (33 - 29.1 ka, 29.1 - 18.2 ka, 18.2 - 9.7 ka and 9.7 ka - present). During the first period, the lagoon formed by collapse of underlying laterite karst terrain, to a level below the local water table, ensuing a continuous record. The lagoon was filled following a wet event, likely related to a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during low sea levels. The results suggest a dominance of dry conditions during the first two identified periods 33 - 18.2 ka. However, no evidence of extreme dry conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum are recorded in the lake sediments. During this time Sanamere Lagoon was a small and shallow water body, with limited organic input. The lagoon expanded and deepened during 18.2 - 9.7 ka, in particular starting at 12.4 ka, following wetter conditions derived from increased monsoon activity and approach of the ocean following sea level rise. The last time period (after 9.7 ka) records increased organic input, related to wet conditions. Between 4.9 - 4.2 ka, high sedimentation rates and changes in the diatom assemblage and geochemical indicators indicate further deepening of the lagoon. Finally, after a slight decrease in rainfall from ~ 4.2 ka, the lagoon stabilised to reach modern conditions. Changes in vegetation and fire were recorded using phytoliths and the hypy fractions. The sequence was characterized by the presence of sedges and woody taxa from the beginning to ~ 9.7 ka, with a minimal contribution from grasses. The redevelopment of the monsoon, between 18.2 and 9.7 ka, sustained the dominance of members of Cyperaceae at the site. After 9.7 ka, and particularly after 7.2 ka, wetter conditions sustained a higher proportion of arboreal taxa during the early and middle Holocene, compared to earlier periods. While fire activity is recorded through the entire sequence, activity is increased only during the Holocene. Peaks in the accumulation rates of the hypy fraction at 9.3 and 7.4 - 7.1 ka indicate an increment in fire activity (sustained by a higher availability of biomass to burn) also during the early and middle Holocene. The results suggest that sea level was a defining feature of the climate and development of Sanamere Lagoon since its formation. The position of the ITCZ and monsoon activity were also determinant factors in the development of the lagoon. This thesis also brings new insights into the changes in environmental conditions in northern Australia, a region with great potential to understand the interactions between climate, vegetation, fire and humans using a long-term perspective. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the understanding of environmental change (vegetation, fire and hydrology) in Australias monsoonal tropics over the last 33,000 years. It also provides a method for building reliable radiocarbon chronologies in lake sediments, as reliable chronologies are critical for the interpretation of palaeoenvironmental archives in the tropics. Further records of environmental change from tropical Australia, a region that has been continuously inhabited by indigenous Australians for 65,000 years, will enable a more detailed understanding of regional monsoon (palaeo)dynamics and human environment interactions. "],["introduction-and-aims.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction and aims 1.1 Introduction 1.2 Thesis aims 1.3 Organization of the Thesis 1.4 Chapter 1 summary", " Chapter 1 Introduction and aims 1.1 Introduction The tropics are home to approximately half of the worlds population and occupy one third of its landmass. Alarmingly, a growing body of evidence shows that these areas will feel the heaviest effects of global warming and climate change (Diffenbaugh et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2015; Wheeler and Braun, 2013). Increasing the number of local climatic and vegetation change records from the tropics is required to inform climatic projections and modelling relevant to managing these future changes. These models can contribute to tackling the environmental and economic impact of climate extremes (such as floods, droughts and related changes in fire activity) in our societies. By lengthening the environmental and climatic data record to thousands of years beyond the historical instrumental record, the uncertainty in projections of future environmental change can be reduced. In particular, knowledge generated by studying long-term palaeoenvironmental records from northern Australia provides important contextual information about climate variability in the Australian sub-tropics, humid and monsoonal tropics. This information can be used, for instance, to improve environmental management strategies for Australian tropical savannas in the future, given their socio-economic importance for agriculture and pastoralism (Stoeckl and Stanley, 2007). Northern Australia is one of the worlds most crucial places to pursue long-term studies regarding human-environment relationships, given that there is evidence of at least 65,000 years of human occupation (Clarkson et al., 2017). Investigating this area of the world contributes to the understanding of the connections between environmental conditions and human societies. To understand climate variability and sensitivity, knowledge of long-term changes on millennial timescales is necessary. Records derived from lake sediments have proven to be useful across a range of geographical areas in recognizing changes in climate, precipitation and anthropogenic activities (Leng and Marshall, 2004; Meyers and Lallier-Vergès, 1999). Lake sediments contain geochemical proxies from a range of sources including the lake body and lake catchment and thus can record environmental and hydrological changes controlled by climate variations and anthropogenic activities. Records derived from lake sediments have proven to be useful across a range of geographical areas in recognizing changes in land use, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology and palaeohydrology. Indeed, palaeolimnology, the use of lakes to derive information about the past environmental conditions, is now a well-established field of study that makes essential contributions to our understanding of past environmental conditions (Catalan et al., 2013; Cohen, 2003). This project focuses on understanding the environmental history and geochronology of the Sanamere Lagoon in northern Cape York, tropical northern Australia (Figure 1.1). Two main considerations guided the development of the project: 1) Geochronology: to provide the information upon which to base optimized dating protocols for tropical lake sediments and 2) Environmental change and palaeohydrology: to create a high-resolution record of environmental change (sedimentological, vegetation and fire) for a region located in the tropical savannas of northern Australia. Figure 1.1: Sanamere Lagoon in Cape York Peninsula 1.2 Thesis aims 1.2.1 Geochronology Aim I. Develop a protocol for building robust chronologies in tropical lake sediments using radiocarbon dating Precise and accurate radiocarbon ages up the radiocarbon dating limit of ~ 50,000 years ago (and the chronologies derived from dating) are critical for testing hypotheses of synchronous (or asynchronous) archaeological, environmental and climatic change and the interpretation of proxy records derived from lake sediment sequences. Although there have been many studies investigating methods for improving chronologies from lake sedimentary archives, most research attempting to identify the material most appropriate for dating has focused on temperate and arctic regions. A single exception deals with peat cores in the tropics, where pollen was found to be the most reliable dating fraction (Wüst et al., 2008). The application of hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) pretreatment to isolate stable polycyclic aromatic carbon (Hypy fraction) for dating appears to offer a viable approach to constructing chronologies from tropical organic spring deposits (Field, S. Marx, et al., 2018), where other materials have been demonstrated to be unreliable. In addition, no previous studies carried out in tropical lakes have tested a diversity of carbon fractions in the same sediment core, as the present study is proposing, to optimize a dating protocol to produce robust lacustrine chronologies. Furthermore, previous studies have reported significant discrepancies between dates for different carbon fractions in lake sediments from the same depth. For example, in boreal and arctic regions, lake sediment, wood and charcoal were found to be older than other macrofossil types, usually by several hundred years (Oswald et al., 2005). Discrepancies have been found also within different types of macrofossils, with some of them more prone to an apparent reservoir effect. This effect can result in anomalously old radiocarbon ages of the dated samples by introducing preaged carbon (???). For example, wood and charcoal were found to be older than other plant remains in some ecosystems. A possible explanation is the slower decomposition and longer terrestrial residence time of these materials (Oswald et al., 2005) Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that there are significant uncertainties associated with dating bulk sediment (Björck et al., 1998; Wüst et al., 2008). Although organic-rich sediments from lake deposits provide diverse materials to analyze for radiocarbon dating, there is considerable uncertainty regarding which organic fraction yields the most reliable radiocarbon ages and how these ages relate to the actual time of deposition of the material. In addition, the relatively hot and moist conditions that characterize much of the tropics influence the preservation of materials that could be analyzed in these settings. For instance, aberrant radiocarbon results could be linked with poorly preserved or degraded charcoal, for example when the combustion yields are lower than usually expected (50-60 % C by weight) (Higham et al., 2009). Also, the materials used for radiocarbon dating are prone to contamination and reservoir effects, which are known to cause serious deviations in the obtained ages, relative to age of deposition. Therefore, as well as providing a robust chronology against which to interpret the record of environmental change at Sanamere Lagoon, the creation of more effective and efficient pretreatment procedures for radiocarbon analyses is relevant to improving laboratory efficiencies, in turn lowering costs and increasing throughput. The Sanamere Lagoon sequence offers a best case, tropical opportunity to a) investigate the consistency of the age models derived from the different carbon fractions that were radiocarbon dated, b) study the causes of potential inconsistences in the radiocarbon dates and correlate the dates with potential disturbances/events along the length of the core. Research questions: How do the radiocarbon dates derived from diverse carbon fractions relate to each other within individual samples, and over time in multiple samples along the core? How and why do reservoir and contamination effects manifest themselves in the radiocarbon measurements of different organic fractions? How consistent are differences observed between the dated carbon fractions? How might differences between the true and observed ages be minimized by selection and dating of a particular ideal fraction? 1.2.2 Environmental change and palaeohydrology Aim II. Reconstruct past climatic variability in northern Cape York Peninsula using the Sanamere Lagoon sediment sequence Aim III. Reconstruct past vegetation and fire activity in northern Cape York Peninsula using the Sanamere Lagoon sediment sequence Although Australia has been the target of large projects (OZ-INTIMATE, Australian INTIMATE) aiming to develop a climate event stratigraphy for the region (Reeves et al., 2013), there are very few records of past terrestrial environmental change of any time depth for the Australian tropics outside the Atherton Tablelands in the wet tropics (refer to chapter 2 for more details about past environmental records). Most (inland) pollen and charcoal records have focused on wetter parts of the region that contain extensive, permanent lakes and swamps or are from the marine realm, in association with marine environmental proxies. Continuous records of environmental change are scarce in the tropical savannas beyond the Holocene, given the poor preservation of proxy material due to the ephemeral nature of most lakes as a result of seasonality in rainfall. A few studies in the Pilbara region of northwestern Australia, the Northern Territory and northern Cape York have yielded some insights into the hydroclimate of the region. Most research has focused in building Holocene pollen records in Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Shulmeister, 1999, 1992; Shulmeister and Lees, 1992), Vanderlin Island (Prebble et al., 2005), Mornington Island (Moss et al., 2015), Bentinck Island (Mackenzie et al., 2017), and northern Cape York (Rowe, 2015, 2007). However, the only studies focusing in palaeohydrology in tropical Australia have been pursued in Lake Carpentaria (Devriendt, 2011; Jones and Torgersen, 1988; McCulloch et al., 1989; Reeves et al., 2007, 2008; Torgersen et al., 1985). Other studies have reconstructed the terrestrial palaeoclimate records, which have been interpreted as providing indirect evidence of palaeohydrological conditions. More recently, palaeoecological records have also emerged from the Kimberley region in Western Australia (Denniston, Wyrwoll, V. J. Polyak, et al., 2013; Field et al., 2017) (see section 2.3.2). During the last 33 ka, important environmental changes have influenced northern Australia (e.g. end of the last glacial period, reactivation of the monsoon, sea level changes, and the onset/intensification of El Niño-Southern Oscillation). These changes impacted and altered the vegetation composition and fire regime across the region. However, most terrestrial studies on this region have provided only Holocene records, covering ~ 12 ka or less (chapter 2). Marine records are longer compared to terrestrial records, and have provided information about climate and vegetation in the tropics of Australia over the last 30 ka. However, these records are low in resolution, and they do not necessarily represent terrestrial conditions on the Australian continent. For instance, the significant changes in sea-level and coastline proximity over this time frame suggest that we have limited knowledge of the multiplicity of factors that may have influenced the climate conditions over thousands of years. Moreover, marine records are primarily based on pollen (which could be sourced from different regions), and this variety of possible sources indicates these records may not represent local conditions. More terrestrial records, covering past glacial and interglacial periods contribute to track and better understand the dynamics between climate, vegetation, fire, and the local expressions of the environmental changes that occurred in the region. While data for northern Australia is becoming more spatially and temporary refined, debates still remain on the climatic and vegetation responses that took place during the Last Glacial (31 ka - 22 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (22 ka - 18 ka) periods in the Australian tropical savannas. For instance, regional syntheses indicate that drier, cooler conditions and low levels of carbon dioxide during the Glacial and LGM periods limited vegetation growth under these climatic conditions (mainly shrubs and herbs), but recent studies suggest that the local climatic responses were highly variable (Tierney et al., 2010). For instance, several wet episodes were initially proposed to have taken place during the Glacial in northern Australia (Nott and Price, 1994; Nott et al., 1996), but recently the dates were declared uncertain (May et al., 2015). The available information for the Glacial and LGM periods in the northern Australian savannas is particularly limited, with interpretation further hindered by the low resolution and chronological uncertainties in the records (Marlon et al., 2013), along with the observation that there are as yet no studies of vegetation and fire patterns for these periods. However, most studies agree that after the LGM, biomass increased and vegetation became more diverse in composition as precipitation, temperature and CO2 increased (Clark et al., 2012). During the early Holocene, evidence from different sites suggests an increase in the frequency of fires starting at around 11 ka (Field, Tyler, et al., 2018) and the establishment of modern vegetation during the middle Holocene (Field, Tyler, et al., 2018; Haberle, 2005; Reeves et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2001). Fire has been recognised as a powerful ecological force, and the need to study fire across temporal scales has been highlighted recently (McLauchlan et al., 2020). The Australian tropical savannas are the most fireprone regions in Australia (Bowman et al., 2010; Russell-Smith and Edwards, 2006; Russell-Smith and Yates, 2007). Previous studies in these ecosystems have determined rainfall seasonality, biomass growth and human interventions to be the modern drivers of fire regime (Gill et al., 2000; Russell-Smith et al., 1997). Conversely, fire influences the climate system by releasing carbon (Bowman et al., 2009). Records of the long-term fire and vegetation dynamics of savanna ecosystems constitute an important resource from which to understand modern patterns of ecological change, and thereby improve vegetation and fire management practices in the region, along with providing information to aid the validation of vegetation change models (Power et al., 2008). However, little is known about the dynamics of vegetation and fire Australian tropical savannas in the past (Reeves et al., 2013). Fire records older than ~12 ka are scarce in the seasonal tropics of Australia. As such, generalizations of the past biomass burning patterns in the region are based on records derived from the wet tropics (Atherton Tablelands, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) (Haberle et al., 2001; Mooney et al., 2011). These studies suggest that fire was infrequent over the Glacial and pre-glacial periods, with sites in the humid tropics (where information is available) showing peaks in biomass burning around 15 ka, probably a result of an increase in available woody fuel and increases in temperature and precipitation around this time (Haberle et al., 2001; Mooney et al., 2011). In northern Australia, the records from Big Willium (7.2 ka) (Stevenson et al., 2015) and Girraween (9.7 ka and 7.7 ka) (Rowe et al., 2019) suggest increased burning during the middle Holocene. Variable patterns have been described for during the Late Holocene, based on records from the Kimberley, northern Australia and the wet tropics (Field, Tyler, et al., 2018; Haberle, 2005; Rowe, 2015, 2007). Some studies have argued that this pattern in the later Holocene reflects an increase in climate variability associated with more active ENSO cyclicity (Kershaw et al., 2007; Mooney et al., 2011). There is a pressing need to extend our knowledge of the environmental dynamics into the seasonally dry parts of Australasia, particularly the Australian savannas that cover much of the Australian tropics (Figure 1.2). More research on the savannas is required to understand their response to climate change and variability in the magnitude of local to regional responses to climate forcing. These differences cause local signals to mask regional or continental scale responses to climate. For example, while in northern Cape York total annual rainfall has increased since 1950, regions along the southern Gulf of Carpentaria have become drier (BOM, 2018). Research questions: Does the Sanamere sequence document periods of increased/decreased water availability in the past? Is there palaeolimnological evidence to suggest past hydrological changes? How do the results of this research relate to the palaeoclimate changes recorded elsewhere for northern Australia (e.g. wetter mid-Holocene (after 9 ka) (Luly et al., 2006), aridity in early Holocene (Nott et al., 1999)? Does the Sanamere sequence document periods of changed fire and vegetation? And if so, how do these changes relate to hydrological change? Figure 1.2: Location of tropical savannas in Australia (yellow) and wet tropics (green) (based on Dinerstein et al. (2017)) 1.3 Organization of the Thesis This thesis is organised according to the aims presented above. After the introductory first chapter, the second chapter presents the specific methodologies and workflow used in this PhD project, along with a general description of the study area and site. In addition, chapter 2 presents a literature review of the current knowledge of past climate, vegetation and fire on Cape York Peninsula in Australia. In the third chapter, the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Sanamere sediment core is described, and this forms the foundation for the subsequent chapters. The fourth chapter addresses Aim I and contains the results of a comparison of several carbon fractions and pretreatments to determine the most reliable chronology for Sanamere Lagoon. Chapter 5 analyses the changes in climate and hydrologic conditions inferred from the lagoon sediment proxy records, while chapter six describes the vegetation and fire history of the area. Chapter 7 discusses the implications of the findings from chapters three to six and provides suggestions for future work (Figure 1.3). Each chapter includes a chapter summary at the end to facilitate the reading. Figure 1.3: Flow chart of the thesis structure, linking thesis chapters to aims 1.4 Chapter 1 summary Three basic aims are essential to understanding the environmental history of northern savannas of Cape York Peninsula: (1) Build a reliable chronology based on radiocarbon dating (2) Reconstruct the changes in palaeohydrology, and (3) Reconstruct the changes in vegetation and fire reflected at the site. These aims elaborate upon two major themes: the standardisation of protocols to build radiocarbon dating chronologies and the understanding of past environmental changes. The research addresses these themes by analysing a lake sediment core from Sanamere Lagoon in Cape York Peninsula. Next, chapter 2 contextualizes the research question through a description of the study site and a review of the literature on past environmental change of Cape York, and the methodological perspectives that inform this research.

In addition, it introduces the methods used in the development of this thesis, following the two main components (geochronology and environmental change). 2.1 Study area Cape York Peninsula is located at the northernmost point of Queensland on the north-eastern coast of Australia. It lies between 10°S and 16°S and is one of the monsoonal regions of Northern Australia, along with the Kimberley and the Top End (Arnhem Land). Most of the Peninsula has a strongly seasonal tropical climate (tropical savanna) (Peel et al., 2007) with just a small area of wetter Am (tropical monsoon) environment on the eastern coast (Peel et al., 2007). Annual rainfall varies from 800mm in the central-southern part to over 2000mm near the Iron Range (Figure 2.1). Approximately 80% of the average annual rainfall falls during the four months from December to March. Temperatures are generally warm to hot, with maximum temperatures being over 40 °C in summer (Environment Science Services, 1995). The vegetation of Cape York Peninsula is dominated by Eucalyptus spp. woodlands, open woodlands, and open-forests, which occupy 64 % of the area. The next most extensive vegetation group is the low open-woodlands, low woodlands, and tall shrublands, dominated by Melaleuca spp. (14.2 % of total area). Grasslands (6.1 %), rainforests (5.6 %) and heathlands (3.3 %) are the next most extensive vegetation types (Fox et al., 2001; Neldner et al., 1995) (Figure 2.2). The region has an abundance of internationally and nationally important natural resources, including remnant rainforests, rich mineral reserves (bauxite, gold, kaolin, silica sand), and several rivers of high ecological significance, high biodiversity, and a strong Indigenous culture (Hitchcock et al., 2013).

The lagoon is 1 km north of the W-E flowing perennial Jardine River (Figure 2.3). The climate of the region is monsoonal with 88 % of the annual 1753 mm rainfall falling between December and April with a mean annual temperature of 27 °C (BOM, 2018). Winds are predominantly from the north-northwest and southeast in January and July, respectively (BOM, 2019) (Figure 2.4). Sanamere Lagoon is considered a sub-coastal wet heath swamp, and a palustrine system (a wetland with more than 30 % emergent vegetation) (Environment &amp; Science, 2018). Sanamere Lagoon is also referred as of value as a wilderness wetland area (Abrahams et al., 1995). The Anggamudi (also known as Angkamuthi), Wuthahti (alternatively Wuthathi) and Yadhaigana (alternatively Yadhaykenu) people are the traditional owners of the Jardine River catchment [australianinstituteofaboriginaltorresstraitislanderstudiesAIATSISCollection2020]. Although most lakes dry out in this region during the dry season (May - November), the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset (Commonwealth of Australia, 2018; Mueller et al., 2016) indicates that the deeper parts of Sanamere Lagoon have been permanently covered by standing water for the last 35 years, despite periods of significantly below average rainfall in this period (Figure 2.5). The water depth during the dry season is 1.2 m for most of the lake. At this level, several relict dune features are exposed, dating from the time of lagoon impoundment. The lake was probably formed as a result of the collapse of laterite karst to form a sinkhole-like depression below the local water table (Grimes and Spate, 2008). During the wet season, the dune features are largely submerged and the lake outflows into the Jardine River. Sanamere is in an enclosed basin surrounded by higher elevation land, with the highest point (57 m a.s.l.) to the north-northeast of the lagoon, close to the current Bamaga Road (Geoscience-Australia, 2015). Based on topography, Sanamere Lagoon has an approximate catchment area of 9 km2, with the lowest overflow point at ~17 m a.s.l. to the west of the lagoon (Figure 2.6).

The lake is likely to have formed by a collapse into cavities formed by dissolution of underlying rock and it is an example of laterite karst (Grimes and Spate, 2008). 2.2.2 Vegetation The vegetation around the lake edge is dominated by sedgeland, open-heaths, dwarf open-heaths and woodlands. Between the edge and 50 m sedges such as Eleocharis sphacelate dominate the landscape (Figure 2.7). Between 50 m and 300 m vegetation transitions to open heath and shrubland, which then account for most plant species, Neofabricia, Asteromyrtus, Baeckea, Jacksonia, Hibbertia, Thryptomene, Allocasuarina and Grevillea (Figure 2.8). At 300 m from the lake there is another transition to Eucalytus woodlands, especially Eucalyptus tetrodonta (Figure 2.9) (Neldner et al., 1995). Smaller sub-canopy trees are common and include Acacia, Grevillea glauca and Grevillea pteridifolia as well as Livisonia palm, with Asteromyrtus present as shrub. Banksia and Casuarina are present in wetter low-lying areas. Grasses dominate the ground cover in this area (Poaceae) and leaf litter is greater than that found in the heathland. Figure 2.7: Vegetation at the Sanamere Lagoon waterline, comprised of sedges and scattered Pandanus Figure 2.8: Open heathland vegetation 50 metres from the waterline Figure 2.9: Eucalyptus woodland at 400 m (right) from the waterline 2.2.3 Soils Sanameres catchment is characterized by deep bleached uniform yellow earthy sands with poor drainage, flooding and low fertility. Soils are primarily derived from sandstone (Kandosols and Tenosols) (Biggs and Philip, 1995). Tenosols on undulating rises of sandstone comprise the largest unit within the Heathlands Landscape. Both the Kandosols and Tenosols are infertile. 2.2.4 Fire Northern Australia is the most fireprone area of Australia, with around 250,000450,000 km2 burnt each year (Russell-Smith, 2016). Australian savannas are characterized by low nutrient soils, highly connected landscapes with few topographic barriers that help generate fire regimes of frequent, intense and large fires (Stevens et al., 2017). These fires are one of the main drivers of vegetation dynamics and climate in the area. For example, the role of fire in controlling the balance between grasses and woody vegetation in savannas have been widely studied (Lehmann et al., 2011), and most literature suggests that frequent fire reduces woody growth rates and tree density, and creates an environment more suitable for C4 grasses (Lehmann et al., 2011). However, recent studies debate the role of fire regimes to reduce canopy vegetative cover and argue that this role is much more limited in impact than often assumed (Veenendaal et al., 2018). In palaeoecological research, burning has also been related to the opening of woodland (canopy and subcanopy) and creating patches of different plant communities (Rowe, 2015). In the 18-year period spanning 2000-2019, the area immediately surrounding Sanamere Lagoon (catchment and beyond) burned on average every 3 to 7 years (Rangelands Fire Information, 2020). Fire scars recorded in this period over the surface of the lagoon (Figure 2.10) are likely a result of error in the determination of fire scars (Rehn, 2020). However, fire scars that extend substantially beyond the water surface may be assumed to represent real scars. Most fires occur each year during the later dry season (July - November). During April to July, fires in northern Australia are associated with lower air temperatures, higher moisture content, burning of smaller areas and may leave unburnt patches. Fires occurring between August and November are typically high intensity, and burn large areas (Evans and Russell-Smith, 2020). Australian Aboriginal people have used fire to manage the landscape for millennia. However, in the early 20th century the removal of Indigenous people to missions might have reduced intensive management of fire regime [cookeCultureEcologyEconomy2009]. Figure 2.10: Number of years areas around Sanamere burned in the 10 years 2010 - 2018 2.3 Climatic context 2.3.1 Modern climate The climate of the northeastern Australias tropical savannas is largely determined by the annual movement of the monsoon system. Along with the monsoon, the southeasterly trade winds along the east coast during the dry season define most of the area (Shi et al., 2016). The monsoons are active from about November to March and are followed by a distinct seasonal drought for the remainder of the year. Tropical cyclones that form over the adjacent ocean also influence the climate of the Peninsula and cause extreme episodic rainfall events during the wet season. The main driver of Australian rainfall variability is El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean (Risbey et al., 2009). However, the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and MaddenJulian oscillation (MJO) also contribute to rainfall variability in northern Australia (BOM, 2010). The influence of the monsoon is controlled by the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP). Their impact in the climate system is determined by the oceanic circulation system. For instance, the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool provides a large moisture source for the Northwest Monsoon and is an important component of the coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that gives rise to the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) (Kershaw and van der Kaars, 2012). The monsoon system is divisible into three spatial components: the Northwest Monsoon that derives its moisture from the equatorial seas to the north and is considered to be pushed by the Asian winter monsoon; the Pseudo-Monsoon of northwestern Australia that is driven by moist winds emanating from the Indian Ocean; and the Quasi-Monsoon that derives much of its moisture from easterly Pacific Ocean winds (Gentilli, 1971). The Australian monsoon alternates between two seasonal phases linked to wind direction. In the winter phase, easterly trade winds bring dry conditions, and particularly the northern Australian region experiences an almost rainless dry season of about 78 months. In the summer, westerly winds bring sustained rainy conditions, torrential rains and, cyclones (Figure 2.11). Figure 2.11: Influences on modern Australian climate. Modified from Risbey et al.

(2013). For each record, the calibrated chronology is used (thousand calibrated years before the present), and referred to as ka throughout. The Glacial period is considered to span 30 ka  18 ka, including the LGM (21 ka 18 ka); the Deglacial is considered to span 18 ka  12 ka; and the Holocene is considered to begin at 12 ka. The Holocene is further split into three classifications: early (12 ka  8 ka); mid (8 ka  4 ka); and late (4 ka  present). Late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) is considered to be from ~ 50 ka  29 ka and Late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 2) from 29 ka - 14 ka. Where the text refers to climatic changes with no specific values, for example warmer or drier, these changes are in relation to the previous time period. As mentioned in chapter 1, the past climate information available for northern Australia is limited (including about monsoon and ENSO dynamics). Besides the monsoon system, the climate of Cape York Peninsula was influenced by changes in sea level (section 2.3.3). Changes in the strength of the monsoon has been documented by studies in adjacent regions (Denniston et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018), along with past changes in sea level and shorelines. However, the data available for several sites in the region are not representative of the entire area. Near Cape York, the longest records (beyond the Holocene) are derived from upland areas to the south (Atherton Tablelands) or marine records which experience local environmental conditions that are not necessarily representative of lowland sites (Shulmeister and Lees, 1995) (Figure 2.12, Table ??). Figure 2.12: Location of sites mentioned in the text (refer to Table ?? for details) 2.3.2.1 Glacial (30 ka - 21 ka) and LGM (21 ka - 18 ka) The longest palaeoecological records from northern Australia come from Lake Carpentaria, and several studies have defined the extent and lake level fluctuations during the late Quaternary in this region (Devriendt, 2011; Jones and Torgersen, 1988; McCulloch et al., 1989; Reeves et al., 2007, 2008; Torgersen et al., 1985). Torgersen et al. (1985) estimated the regional evaporation to precipitation ratio to have remained twice the modern ratio between 41 ka to 12 ka, suggesting drier conditions. Additionally, irregular patterns of precipitation during the LGM are suggested by the highly variable Mg/Ca, Na/Ca, Sr/Ca, and \\(\\delta\\)18O. Additional evidence of aridity in northern Australia comes from analysis of aeolian dust activity (De Deckker, 2001; De Deckker et al., 1991) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The most pronounced arid period peaks around 21.5 ka, corresponding to the start of the period of lowest global sea level and glacial advance. Other peaks were found at ~ 25.5 ka, ~ 29.5 ka, 24 ka, and 19.3 ka (De Deckker, 2001). Furthermore, evidence of fluvial activity in the north of Australia generally supports drier conditions through the LGM (Nanson et al., 1993, 1991). There are no terrestrial records of climate, vegetation, and fire in Cape York between 30 ka - 18 ka. All of the available records are from south Cape York in the humid, not seasonal, tropics on the Atherton Tablelands. In this area, three sites have been extensively studied: Lynchs crater (Kershaw et al., 2007; Turney et al., 2004, 2006), Lake Euramoo (Haberle, 2005), and Bromfield swamp (Burrows et al., 2016). The available lines of evidence suggest the Glacial and LGM periods to be drier and cooler than today in this sector. Before the LGM, palynological analyses report dry, open woodlands on the Atherton Tablelands, Lynchs Crater and Lake Euramoo (Kershaw, 1994; Turney et al., 2004). Vegetation records from Lynchs Crater, Lake Euramoo (Haberle, 2005) and ODP 820 (Moss and Kershaw, 2007) suggest the dominance of sclerophyll woodland (i.e. Casuarinaceae and Myrtaceae). Except for Lynchs Crater, other records from the region indicate increased presence of grasses during the LGM (Petherick et al., 2011). Further evidence of elevated values of Poaceae during the LGM is found in the pollen record from nearby marine core ODP820 (Moss and Kershaw, 2007). Burrows et al. (2016) suggested marked changes in effective precipitation (towards drier conditions) at 32.7 ka, 30.1 ka, 24.7 ka, and 21.9 ka in Bromfield Swamp. In the broader tropical Australasian region, most studies agree on evidence of drier, cooler conditions between ~ 33 ka and 18 ka across the area (Denniston, Wyrwoll, Asmerom, et al., 2013; DiNezio and Tierney, 2013; Reeves et al., 2013), with a lesser number reporting the existence of wetter events, some of them episodic (Burrows et al., 2016; Denniston et al., 2017; Muller et al., 2008; Nott et al., 1996). For instance, extreme flood events just before 23 ka were detected by Nott et al. (1996) and Nott and Price (1999), although the timing of these events should be taken with caution as dates could be overestimated (May et al., 2015). Muller et al. (2008) found evidence of wet conditions during Heinrich events at 30 ka  29 ka and 24 ka  23 ka in Lynchs Crater. Changes in monsoon strength during the LGM have been proposed by several studies (Denniston et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018). For example, Yan et al. (2018) found that while the annual mean precipitation over the Australian monsoon region decreased, the annual range was enhanced. Except for Lake Carpentaria, all studies from the region have fire records, most of them younger than ~ 12 ka. Both Lynchs Crater and ODP 820 have records for the LGM and the Glacial, with high charcoal values during the LGM (Kershaw, 1994; Kershaw et al., 2007; Moss and Kershaw, 2007) or increased availability of biomass (e.g. sclerophyll woodland) for burning (Kershaw, 1994). 2.3.2.2 Deglacial (18 ka - 12 ka) The increase in lake level at Lake Carpentaria during the Deglacial suggests wetter conditions in the region, possibly associated with the reactivation of the monsoon. While wetter conditions are reported in Lake Euramoo related to the growth of Eucalyptus woodland, Lynchs Crater and the ODP 820 records show evidence of dry conditions based on vegetation (Kershaw et al., 2007; Kershaw and Nix, 1988; Moss and Kershaw, 2007; Turney et al., 2004). Likewise, in Broomsfield swamp decreases in effective precipitation at 13.9 ka  13.4 ka and 11.9 ka were identified (Burrows et al., 2016). Fire records in the dry tropics report negligible or low burning activity during this period (Field et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2019), except for Lake Euramoo, where fire was much more prominent in the landscape starting at 16.8 ka. 2.3.2.3 Holocene (12 ka - Present) Early Holocene (12 ka - 8 ka) Warmer and wetter conditions have been proposed to be dominant during the early Holocene in the northern Australian tropics. Records from the west of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Four Mile Billabong and Walala) point to effective precipitation rises from ~ 10 ka to 5 ka. The very few studies from the savannas of Cape York are limited to those derived from lake sediment cores with records beginning at the middle Holocene. These studies include Big and Little Willum (Proske et al., 2017; Stevenson et al., 2015) and Three-Quarter Mile Lake (Luly et al., 2006), and propose an increase in effective precipitation ~ 7.9 ka, consistent with studies from the Atherton Tablelands and the Kimberley (Denniston, Wyrwoll, V. J. Polyak, et al., 2013; Haberle, 2005; Rowe et al., 2019; Shulmeister, 1992). In Big Willum, as open water developed, from ~ 7 ka  5 ka, grass and sedge representation declined as the swampy basin bottom became fully submerged. Several coastal sites in the area (Western Torres Strait, Lizard Island) record widespread mangrove forest development led by the early Holocene sea level rise (Proske and Haberle, 2012; Rowe, 2007). Changes in vegetation suggest increased rainfall in Lake Euramoo. Haberle (2005) found the maximum rate of increase in rainforest between 9.6 ka and 8.7 ka. These changes are most likely to represent the local establishment of closed canopy rainforest under the influence of increasing precipitation at Lake Euramoo. Mid and Late Holocene (8 ka - Present) The middle Holocene has also been identified as a period of increased precipitation in the northeastern Australias humid tropics and Western Torres Strait. In Broomfield Swamp, geochemical evidence derived from elemental counts (ITRAX) (rise in Ti and Ge) suggests a wetter period (8.5 ka - 5.9 ka) compared to the periods before and after (Burrows et al., 2016). Another phase of increased precipitation for Lake Euramoo is suggested around 7.3 ka to 6.3 ka, when rainforest achieved its maximum extent across the Atherton Tablelands. Shulmeister (1999) places the mid-Holocene precipitation maximum between 5 ka - 3.7 ka for the Northern Territory and north Queensland. In the Torres Strait, the prominence of island rainforest elements during the early-mid Holocene likely reflects the timing and influence of higher rainfall and humid climate. Additional evidence of a wetter phase is present at 6 ka in Lizard Island, where a possible cyclone event was documented (Proske and Haberle, 2012). Extensive stable mangrove communities dominated coastal Torres Strait, starting at 6 ka and 3 ka (Rowe, 2007). Overall, pollen from northern Australia also reflects woodland expansion at this time, and modern vegetation established (Proske et al., 2014). Whiterspoon swamp also shows a wetter phase during the mid-Holocene, with an increase in sedges and sclerophyll taxa (Moss et al., 2012). Quantitative estimates derived from offshore pollen records also indicate peak precipitation between 7 ka and 6 ka (van der Kaars et al., 2006). These changes are associated with the flooding of the continental shelf and the big swamp phase, as sea levels increase during the deglaciation and early Holocene (Woodroffe et al., 1985). Two increases in charcoal accumulation were identified at 8 ka in Lake Euramoo (Haberle, 2005), while in Big Willum a peak was identified at 7.2 ka (Stevenson et al., 2015). Vanderlin Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria shows an increase around 6 ka. In summary, these peaks suggest increased burning during the middle Holocene in the area. In northern Australia, the late Holocene is associated with climatic variability, peat/wetland establishment and localised episodic aridity. For example, the available records from Lake Euramoo and Lynchs Crater agree that this period was characterised by increased seasonality (Haberle, 2005; Reeves et al., 2013). Similarly, Head and Fullager (1992) identify increasing climatic variability in the last 3000 years from dune instability in the East Kimberley. Evidence and derived discussions from several sites across northern Australia from Lees (1992), Shulmeister (1999), and Gagan et al. (2004), including the western Torres-Strait (Rowe, 2007) point to conditions during the mid-to-late Holocene as much drier than the previous early-to-mid Holocene phase. Haberle (2005) identifies drier conditions and increased rainfall seasonality after ~ 4 ka. Stevenson et al. (2015) note the end of a warm and wet period at ~ 5 ka at Big Willum Swamp and identify the period between 1 ka - 0.4 ka as the period of greatest variability at the site. Similarly, in Witherspoon swamp, Moss et al. (2015) identified a period of dry conditions starting at 2 ka. Burrows et al. (2016) identified a dry event in the Bromfield Swamp and Quincan Crater records at 4.1 ka as a possible indicator of substantial climate change. Mackenzie et al. (2017) describe variable conditions over the last 1.25 ka in the South Wellesley Islands, including storm events, wet conditions at one site around 0.750 ka and a drying trend beginning in the last 150-50 years across three swamps. The Late Holocene was also a period of wetland and peat establishment reported at several sites (Luly et al., 2006; Rowe, 2015; Stevenson et al., 2015). In the Torres Strait Islands, freshwater swamps developed by 2.6 ka with palynological records dominated by Melaleuca and the herbaceous swamp taxa Leptocarpus and Cyperaceae (Rowe, 2015). Records at Boigu Gawat 1 and Boigu Gawat 2 in Torres Strait, suggest that wetlands became more productive, organic material increased and coastal influence was reduced (Rowe, 2015, 2007). Records in the Gulf of Carpentaria show expansion and development in the late-Holocene. Walala swamp in Vanderlin Island was fully developed by 4.5 ka with organic sediments increasing in the last 2 ka (Prebble et al., 2005). Four Mile Billabong also expanded in the last 1 ka. At Big Willum swamp increased precipitation is maintained between 2.2 ka and 1.3 ka (Proske et al., 2017). Locations such as the Torres-Strait (Rowe, 2015) show an increase in charcoal accumulation (and therefore, fire) during the last millennium before the present. Big Willum in Western Cape York shows peaks after 2 ka. Variable patterns of burning have been identified during the Late Holocene (Field, Tyler, et al., 2018; Haberle, 2005; Rowe, 2015, 2007). Some studies have argued that this pattern in the later Holocene reflects an increase in climate variability associated with more active ENSO cyclicity (Kershaw et al., 2007; Mooney et al., 2011). 2.3.3 Palaeogeography of Cape York Peninsula (33 ka - Present) This section presents the available information on changes on palaeogeography, specifically sea level and dune formation in northern Australia and the broader region. Cape York Peninsula underwent major changes in geography during the last 33 ka, especially related to changes in sea level. By compiling a range of Late Quaternary sea-level indicator data, Brooke et al. (2017) and Lambeck et al. (2014) found an abrupt decrease in sea level ~ 30 ka (from - 83 m to - 126 m) in the Australian/South Pacific region (Figure 2.14, Figure 2.15 and Table ??). In Lake Carpentaria, during MIS 3 (57 ka- 29 ka), fully lacustrine conditions are confirmed by the ostracod Ba/Ca ratios, and the lake level corresponding to the - 60 m bathymetric contour, including increased intensity of fluvial sediment transport occurred during the MIS 3 and MIS 1 (Reeves et al., 2008). Additional records from Lake Carpentaria indicate that lake levels dropped during the LGM (from the 59 m bathymetric contour during mid-MIS 3 to the 63 m bathymetric contour during the LGM). Episodes of sand deposition (aeolian or fluvial origin) at 26 ka, 24 ka and 21.5 ka at Lake Carpentaria are interpreted as arid events (De Deckker, 2001) that closely match periods of elevated monsoon rainfall in the Ball Gown Cave record (northwestern Australia) (Denniston, Wyrwoll, Asmerom, et al., 2013). During the LGM, large fluctuations of the lake level at the seasonal and interannual time scale are inferred from the \\(\\delta\\)18O values and trace-element ratios of ostracod shells (Devriendt, 2011). Fluvial activity continued through this period to maintain the lake permanently in the deeper regions of the basin. The sedimentary record indicates a temporary contraction of the lake to around the  63 m contour (2319 ka), during which the sea was at its lowest level (approximately  125 m) (Brooke et al., 2017; Yokoyama et al., 2001). Lowered glacial sea level exposed the Sahul shelf, the continental shelf extending over from the northern coast of Australia to the island of New Guinea, south of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Timor Sea. Its exposure could have sizable impact on IPWP climate given their central location between areas of deep convection of the IPWP (Di Nezio et al., 2016) (Figure 2.13). Low sea levels during the LGM also influenced dune formation and emplacement in tropical Australia (Figure 2.16). Dune emplacements in Cape Arnhem (Lees et al., 1995), Cape Flattery and Shelburne Bay between 24 and 18 ka appear to represent a period of widespread dune activity associated with the LGM. Dune formation occurred at glacial low sea levels when wide areas of continental shelf became exposed to wind action (Lees, 2006, 1992; Lees et al., 1990) (Figure 2.15). Lagoons also record aeolian and dune activity. For example, in Native Companion Lagoon (NCL), in North Stradbroke Island (southeast Queensland), the significant local sand and dust content of the NCL record for this period indicate that the dunes surrounding NCL were active, most likely in response to a reduced cover of vegetation. The LGM is shown as the period of maximum aeolian sedimentation, as a result of decreased precipitation. Loss of vegetation cover and subsequent destabilization of dunes would account for the increased deposition of local North Stradbroke Island sediments in Native Companion Lagoon at this time (McGowan et al., 2008; Petherick et al., 2009). In a regional context, several studies have highlighted the impact of changing sea levels on the hydroclimate. For example, DiNezio and Tierney (2013) highlight the importance of continental shelf exposure during low sea levels on IPWP hydrology during the LGM, when comparing the results from several studies in the region. The study by DiNezio and Tierney (2013) also suggests that sea level is a first-order driver of tropical hydroclimate on glacialinterglacial timescales, and that the exposure of the Sunda Shelf best explain the pattern of hydroclimatic change inferred from the proxies. Dry conditions may have been maintained until flooding of the SundaSahul shelf, at the end of the deglaciation, according to several studies (e.g. De Deckker et al., 2003; DiNezio and Tierney, 2013). Figure 2.13: Sahul ~ 20 ka. Yellow line denotes modern coastline. Source: http://sahultime.monash.edu.au/ Figure 2.14: Changes in sea level according to Lambeck et al. (2014) At Lake Carpentaria, beginning at 18 ka there is evidence of increased run-off and weathering. Increasing contributions from southern rivers and decreased salinity during 18 ka - 15 ka are interpreted as evidence of the reactivation of the monsoon. Sedimentological evidence suggests a significant increase in lake level and extent after 18 ka (Reeves et al., 2008). This is confirmed by freshening of the lake and a considerable decrease in the lake water \\(\\delta\\)18O variability after 18 ka (Reeves et al., 2008). The maximum lake level (&gt; 3 m average depth) and extent (&gt; 100,000 km2), as well as the lowest salinity, are recorded between 14 ka and 12 ka, suggesting the monsoon reached northeastern Australia around this time (Reeves et al., 2008). A shell-rich layer (19.0 ka  17.1 ka) indicates a highly productive environment, associated with an influx of fresh water and increased precipitation. These changes are reflected in the sea level curve built by Brooke et al. (2017). In the western equatorial Pacific (Sulawesi, Indonesia), dry conditions during the late glacial were terminated as a result of rising sea levels and the inundation of shallow continental shelves in the region, after the onset of deglaciation (DiNezio and Tierney, 2013; Griffiths et al., 2013). Significant changes in speleothem \\(\\delta\\)18O also coincide with the rapid flooding of the Sahul (~ 12 ka  11 ka) and Sunda (~ 8.5 ka) shelves (Krause et al., 2019). The corresponding changes in speleothem \\(\\delta\\)18O at Sulawesi likely represent a combination of the reorganisation of local water masses, changes in source moisture pathways and intensification of the Walker circulation caused by enhanced convection over newly formed seas in the western equatorial Pacific region (DiNezio and Tierney, 2013; Griffiths et al., 2009; Krause et al., 2019). From ~ 12 ka important changes in sea level are recorded based on studies from Lake Carpentaria and the South Wellesley Archipelago (Sloss et al., 2018). From 12 ka, oceanic waters transgressed the Arafura Sill, and by 10.7 ka, the Lake Carpentaria region had become marine (Chivas et al., 2001; McCulloch et al., 1989). Full marine conditions attained in the Gulf of Carpentaria by 10.5 ka. Sloss et al. (2018) found that sea-level rose from 53 m (depth of the Arafura Sill) (Harris et al., 2008; Reeves et al., 2008; Sloss et al., 2018) at ca. 11.7 ka to ca. 25 m by 9.8 ka (Sloss et al., 2018) culminating in a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand (7.7 ka 4 ka) and a corresponding period of increased precipitation and temperature during the Holocene. Coastal flooding facilitated increased moisture and heat transfer/transport fueling monsoon activity. Data from Karumba, in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, indicate that sea level was 2.5 m higher around 6.4 ka. Possibly, these conditions would increasily expose Sanamere Lagoon to moisture and wind from the sea more than ever before. After 2 ka, sea level fell to present level (Lewis et al., 2013). Additional studies from stalagmites in southeast Indonesia (Griffiths et al., 2009) also support the idea that lowered sea level had a large effect on IPWP hydroclimate from the LGM to 9.5ka, when the Sunda Shelf was nearly flooded. Moreover, the early Holocene intensification of monsoon precipitation was driven by sea-level rise, which increased the supply of moisture to the Indonesian archipelago. Monsoon precipitation intensified even more rapidly from 11 ka to 7 ka, when the Indonesian continental shelf was flooded by global sea-level rise. Figure 2.15: Changes in sea level in the Gulf of Carpentaria A drying trend is noted in several of the records during the mid Holocene (Ball Gown Cave, Black Springs) and speleothems of Flores, coincident with increased precipitation in Borneo. A contraction of the IPWP is also recorded in the corals of this region (Reeves et al., 2013). The re-establishment of vegetation caused by rising sea levels during the mid Holocene also contributed to dune stabilisation. The impact of sea level regression during the late Holocene is also documented in Bentinck Island, where the mangrove community transitioned to woodland and wetland dominated vegetation over the last 850 years (Mackenzie et al., 2020). These changes also determined the timing of wetland development on the site, transitioning from coastal environments to wetlands between 0.8 and 0.4 ka (Mackenzie et al., 2017). Figure 2.16: Sites with evidence of dune activity in Cape York Peninsula and surroundings 2.4 Background to the methods used in the thesis The following sections develop the theoretical framework to interpret the results from chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. Chapter 3 examines the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Sanamere lake sediment core. Chapter 4 examines six carbon fractions in the sediment samples to determine which fraction and technique pre-treatment is most appropriate to obtain reliable radiocarbon dating results. Chapters 5 and 6 describe the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for Sanamere Lagoon using multiple proxy records. 2.4.1 Geochronology (Aim I) 2.4.1.1 Radiocarbon dating The ubiquitous presence of carbon in lacustrine environments makes radiocarbon dating one of the most commonly used and established techniques to date lake sediments. Carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes, two of which are stable (C-12 and C-13) and one (C-14) which is unstable or radioactive. The production of C-14 takes place as a result of several nuclear reactions of 14N with cosmic rays to form C-14 and a proton. Within hours, C-14 atoms undergo oxidation to form carbon dioxide (14CO2). Once a 14C-tagged CO2 molecule reaches the surface of the earth, it enters into the carbon cycle. About 85 % of C-14 remains in ocean water and the rest stays in terrestrial environments, where plants fix it in their cellular structures by photosynthesis, while other organisms obtain it secondarily by ingestion. Metabolic processes maintain the C-14 content of living organisms in equilibrium with atmospheric C-14. These metabolic processes cease at the death of an animal or plant and the amount of C-14 will begin to decrease by decay at a rate determined by the C-14 half-life. The radiocarbon age of a given sample is based on measurement of residual C-14 content (Aitken, 1990; Wood, 2015). Some of the challenges associated with working with radiocarbon dating include changes in the natural production rate of radiocarbon in the atmosphere and sample integrity. Regarding the first factor, the atmospheric production of radiocarbon has varied through time, and these changes cause systematic offsets between radiocarbon ages and calendrical ages. Calibration curves calculated by dating materials of precisely known age, such as tree rings have been used to overcome this discrepancy (Aitken, 1990). IntCal20, the most updated calibration curve includes a wealth of new data and was extended to 55,000 cal BP (???). Regarding the second factor, the ability of a C-14 determination to accurately date an event depends on the integrity of the sample and the degree of association between the dated material and the event of interest. The integrity of the sample can be compromised by the incorporation of foreign carbonaceous materials into a sample matrix. For lake sediments, stratigraphic mixing, for example, by bioturbation is a common and serious problem, as it compromises the integrity of the sample. Bioturbation is one of the main causes of younger particles being reworked included in older deposits and viceversa. Erosion and floods can cause remobilized older carbon to be included in younger deposits. Samples that are in contact with groundwater could have absorbed inorganic carbonates that may alter the true date. The effect of contaminants can be mitigated if information about the age of the contaminant, and the percentage contribution of the contaminant is available, though this is rarely possible (Aitken, 1990; Wood, 2015). Selection of carbon fraction and pretreatment Given the importance of the integrity of the sample to the reliability of radiocarbon dating, the selection of the carbon fraction to date and the pretreatment to apply is fundamentally important. There is general agreement about the suitability of some materials for dating, including very delicate materials, such as whole terrestrial leaves (which are unlikely to survive long periods of transport and reworking). There is more controversy around the general suitability of some macrofossils and charcoal, which have been reported to account for anomalous dates. Macrofossils can take up contamination from fungi (Wohlfarth et al., 1998) and have been shown to yield systematic differences between series of paired analyses on two types of macrofossils (Turney et al., 2000). Other materials, including bulk sediment and pollen, have been widely used, but previous studies have shown them to yield anomalous ages in at least some cases (Wang et al., 1996). Stable polycyclic aromatic carbon (SPAC) has been proposed as an alternative to the issues shown in other materials (Field, S. Marx, et al., 2018; Orr et al., 2020). Hypy fraction Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) (hereafter Hypy fraction) with and aromatic ring size of &gt; 7, is the solid carbonaceous residue remaining after hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) and it is a demonstrably indigenous component of the original charcoal (Meredith et al., 2012). As such, the hypy fraction is likely to produce a reliable radiocarbon date, as the processes remove labile carbon including contaminants (&gt; 98 %) (Orr et al., 2020). Although a relatively new technique, hypy has been successfully applied in a number of different studies (Bird et al., 2014; Field, Tyler, et al., 2018). Incomplete removal of modern contamination has been shown for charcoal formed at &lt; 350 °C as a small fraction of the labile carbon component may also be pyrolysed during HyPy treatment (Bird et al., 2014). During hypy, samples undergo pyrolysis aided by high hydrogen pressures in the presence of sulphided molybdenum catalyst (Ascough et al., 2009, 2010; Wurster et al., 2012). Bulk organics (bulk organic matter) When no macro-organic remains are visible in lake sediment matrices, dating bulk sediments is the one of the most commonly used options. The organic components of bulk sediments are divided in three main categories, according to their solubility in acid and base (Bayliss, 2009; van der Plicht et al., 2019). Humic acids: alkali soluble, acid insoluble and thought to derive from the decay of plant material that grew on the site as the sediment accumulated. Humin: acid and alkali insoluble, thought to consist of the physical remains of the plant/algal material. Humins are generally considered to be the most stable C fraction within the sedimentary profile (Pessenda et al., 2001). Total organic fraction: remains after the acid soluble fraction has been removed. Humic acid and humin fractions combined. Given the multiple sources from which carbon could have derived (Bronk Ramsey, 2008), the contribution of contaminants increases considerably for any bulk organic matter fraction. Several studies have found this fraction to be consistently younger than other fractions (Pessenda et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1996). Pollen concentrate Pollen concentrate is used as another alternative when macroscopic carbon fractions are not available. Several studies have found pollen concentrates to yield older 14C dates compared to other fractions (Fletcher et al., 2017; Neulieb, 2013), while others have found it to be younger (May et al., 2018), yielding significantly different chronologies compared to other fractions. In part this may be due to the greater mobility of pollen and pollen sized material in some environments (Clymo and Mackay, 1987) and therefore, the possibility of being reworked. In addition, the porous structure and high surface to volume ratio of the pollen grain walls make them prone to store exogenous carbon materials (Kilian et al., 2002). These impurities can lead to unreliable dates (Fletcher et al., 2017). Cellulose Although cellulose is considered one of the fractions that yields reliable dates, the extraction of holocellulose is commonly complex and in some cases unreliable. For instance, during the early Holocene, differences of up to 1000 years are observed between lake sediment cellulose and terrestrial plant fossils. This disagreement is probably caused by the contribution of 14C-depleted cellulose synthesized by aquatic plants/algae in the lake (Kitagawa et al., 2007). Furthermore, the most commonly used procedures to extract cellulose are time-consuming and require excessive organic solvents (Wolfe et al., 2007). Recently, Gillespie (2019) implemented a novel extraction protocol that includes the use of less toxic chemicals in quicker steps to overcome the disadvantages inherent in the previous procedures. Macro/microcharcoal Macrocharcoal (&gt; 250 \\(\\mu\\)m) and microcharcoal (&lt; 250 \\(\\mu\\)m,&gt; 63 \\(\\mu\\)m) are very commonly dated when available, and considered to be inert. However, standard pretreatment can lead to unremoved contamination and samples can be destroyed after this procedure, with no remaining material to be dated (Bird and Ascough, 2012). Additionally, Bird (2007) showed that chemical modifications can occur on the surface of charcoal and that its porous nature makes it especially prone to absorb exogenous carbon and microbes. Iron carbonate (siderite) and oxides of different cations may also be formed during diagenesis. If this source of carbon is not removed, it can lead to anomalous dates (Bird, 2007). Although they are usually not separated, some studies suggest that microcharcoal and macrocharcoal represent different sources, with microcharcoal coming from further way from the site deposition (as fine particles are more likely to be transported by wind or water over long distances before deposition in the location from which they are ultimately collected) compared to macrocharcoal, which is unlikely to move long distances. This difference could yield different radiocarbon dates for macro and microcharcoal from the same sample (Carcaillet et al., 2001). 2.4.2 Environmental change and palaeohydrology (Aims II and III) Chapter 5 presents a multi-proxy record of geochemical (micro X-ray fluorescence [\\(\\mu\\)XRF] scanning), carbon and nitrogen content and associated stable isotopes, physical (grain size) and biological (diatom) proxy data sets for Sanamere Lagoon. The Chapter aims to develop a record of hydroclimatic changes in an under-studied region of northeast Australia. Chapter 6 contributes to refining the vegetation and fire record using a phytolith, carbon isotope and pyrogenic carbon-based reconstruction of Sanamere Lagoon in northern Cape York, Australia. The following sections present the methodological foundation for these chapters. 2.4.3 Palaeohydrology Diatoms Carbonates are one of the most commonly used materials in palaeohydrological studies, and they are used to infer the isotope composition of the lake water at its time of formation, and by inference the isotope composition of precipitation. Precipitation isotope ratios have been correlated with mean surface air temperature at mid-to high-latitudes, or with the amount of precipitation in tropical areas. However, in non-alkaline, dilute, open lakes, carbonates may be rare or absent. In lakes where carbonate is not preserved, silica bodies can be used as an alternative isotope proxy host to carbonates (Hu and Shemesh, 2003; Lamb et al., 2005). For example, diatoms are photosynthetic algae that secrete a shell composed of opaline silica (SiO2·nH2O) and are present in many lake sedimentary records. In very alkaline lakes (&gt; pH 9) or lakes where silica is limited, diatoms are often preserved only in low concentration (Barker et al., 1994). Diatom species inhabit specific environments based on their tolerance ranges and morphology (Battarbee et al., 2002). For palaeoenvironmental purposes, classification systems use pH, habitat and salinity as determinant variables to understand changes in diatom abundance in the past. Habitat can be placed into two categories: benthic and planktonic species. Planktonic species live as free-floating cells in the plankton of ponds, lakes and oceans. Benthic species form attachments to surfaces and are further classified according to their attachment to the substratum. Epilithic species attach to rocks and geological surfaces, epipsammic species to sand grains, epizoic species to animals and epiphytic species are those that attach themselves to plants and other algae species. Finally, epipelic species are those that live on the benthos or sediment on the bottom of the aquatic environment while endopelic species live within sediment (Battarbee et al., 2002) (Table ?? and Table ??). Diatoms are among the most common proxies that have been used for a long time in tropical areas to infer lake level, with the first studies pursued in Africa (Gasse and Street, 1978; Gasse, 1987). Diatom composition and relative abundances potentially offer a more precise measure of palaeohydrological change than palynological data (Prebble et al., 2005; Wolin and Stone, 2010). Other lake characteristics that are derived from these organisms include pH, sedimentary processes, changes in evaporation, salinity, turbidity and trophic status of a water body (Proske et al., 2017). Diverse applications and research questions in arctic and subartic regions include peat water content, flood frequency, river discharge, effective moisture and ice cover (Moser et al., 2000). The inclusion of oxygen stable isotope analysis on diatoms (\\(\\delta\\)18Odiatom) has allowed the calculation of quantitative parameters including temperature and precipitation. \\(\\delta\\)18Odiatom has been used as a proxy for climate and hydrological change in many studies across many geographical regions (Leng and Barker, 2006; Leng and Henderson, 2013). The mineral-water isotope fractionation factor has been estimated previously from analyses of diatoms from freshwater (and marine) sediments. Several studies show that in lacustrine (and marine) systems no oxygen isotope vital effect exists in diatoms (Leng and Barker, 2006). Diatoms have provided considerable information about the palaeohydrology and hydroclimate of many tropical regions, including Australia (Luly et al., 2006; Prebble et al., 2005; Proske et al., 2017; Tibby and Haberle, 2007), with the majority of the studies pursued in the east portion of the continent. For example, autecological information from different species indicate changes in the water level of the lakes (Proske et al., 2017; Tibby and Haberle, 2007) or major shifts in local hydrology, e.g. from a perennial swamp to open lake. Perennial lake conditions are identified by the overlap between planktonic/benthic and littoral/benthic diatom taxa (Prebble et al., 2005). The environmental inferences drawn from diatoms are based on the autecology of individual diatom species or the study of the interactions of each species with the living and nonliving factors of its environment. For example, inference models link diatom ecological tolerances with physico-chemical variables that can be used to and infer palaeoecological conditions (Battarbee et al., 2002). On Cape York Peninsula, diatom composition is correlated with total alkalinity, bicarbonate concentration, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and latitude (Negus et al., 2019). This correlation confrms the potential of using these organisms as palaeoclimate proxies in this area. Sediment and isotope geochemistry Titanium concentration and grain size analysis are commonly used to infer runoff and transportation of clastic materials into a lake (Vázquez et al., 2017). As with other proxies based on sediment physical properties, this depends on a clear understanding of climatic effects on sedimentology for a specific catchment (Douglas et al., 2016). The presence of elements such as iron, titanium and aluminum in lake and marine sediments often indicate times of greater material transport under conditions of higher precipitation and consequent runoff. The drivers of bulk sediment elemental geochemistry vary widely, and often need to be determined for each catchment and sedimentary system. The \\(\\delta\\)13C measurements of bulk sediments can be used to infer changes in the source of organic carbon in lake sediments. In some cases, such measures provide insights into vegetation change, and distinction between terrestrial and aquatic input, C3 (trees and shrubs) and C4 plants (tropical grasses), which can be related to climate (Mays et al., 2017). Grain size Variability in clastic grain size can indicate changing lake levels, and the amount and energy of runoff into a sedimentary basin. Likewise, grain size analysis can be an indicator of the amount and intensity of flood events (Conroy et al., 2008). Some studies suggest that increased precipitation in closed-basin lake catchments transport larger grains from the catchment. Therefore, grain size in the sediment is seen as a function of the intensity and/or amount of rainfall (Chen et al., 2004). Grain size measurements inform on the sources of detrital material and may help determine possible depositional processes (fluvial or aeolian) prevailing through different periods (Burrows et al., 2016). In Lake Barrine, in northeast Australia, grain size analysis, along with other proxies, was taken to indicate fluctuations in water level (Walker, 2007). 2.4.4 Fire Optical charcoal analysis is commonly used as a proxy for fire activity in the past. Although the use of hypy fractions as a tracer of past fire activity is in its infancy, the study by Bird et al. (2019) found that hypy fractions are able to reproduce similar fire activity signals when compared to charcoal counting records in northern Australia, with the advantage of removing the time-consuming particle counting step. Furthermore, the measurement of the carbon isotope composition of the pyrogenic carbon provides information on the proportions of C3 and C4 (grass) vegetation being burnt. In the study by Bird et al. (2019), the recurrence of fire regimes (linked to changes in vegetation and climate) were derived using pyrogenic carbon abundance measured by hydrogen pyrolysis (Wurster et al., 2012) (section 2.4.1.1). However, the results from optical charcoal analysis and the Hypy fraction are not directly comparable as the proportion of pyrogenic carbon (Hypy fraction) to charcoal increases with increasing fire intensity (therefore representing higher intensity fires compared to the macroscopic and microscopic charcoal particles) (Bird and Ascough, 2012). The study of fire regime in the past mostly relies on the measurement of charcoal abundance in sediments (Higuera et al., 2010), and particle counting, either manually (Ali et al., 2009) or using computer-assisted tools (Conedera et al., 2009). As an alternative, the abundance of pyrogenic carbon (measured by an incandescencebased method) has been found to work as a moderate tracer of historical fire activity (Chellman et al., 2018). 2.4.5 Vegetation Carbon isotopes \\(\\delta\\)13C The source of organic matter input into a lake can be determined using bulk sedimentary organic carbon isotope values. The stable carbon isotope composition of forests varies with the type of forest present and end-members of corresponding biomes have different \\(\\delta\\)13C values. For instance, for tropical rainforest the carbon isotopic value is -27 ; for tropical seasonal forest -24.8  and for tropical deciduous forest -22  (Diefendorf et al., 2010).Those \\(\\delta\\)13C values above baseline 13C values for tropical deciduous seasonal forests, unambiguously indicate that by implication, tropical grasses were a substantial part of the environments and that the hydroclimate was significantly drier and/or more seasonal than when 13C values are lower (Wurster et al., 2019). As an example, the \\(\\delta\\)13C values for forest end-members in tropical savannas are expected to be -25 . Therefore \\(\\delta\\)13C values above ~ -24 to -25  unambiguously indicate the presence of tropical grasses and that the hydroclimate was significantly drier and/or more seasonal than when values are lower than this threshold (Diefendorf et al., 2010). In addition, understanding the variation in C4 vs C3 being burnt through analysis of pyrogenic carbon in a sedimentary record can provide insight into the balance of trees versus grass in the surrounding area and hence possible environmental conditions at the time of burning (Wurster et al. 2017). Thus, the \\(\\delta\\)13C of pyrogenic carbon (\\(\\delta\\)13PyC) can be used to make inferences about the vegetation being burnt, although the relationship is unlikely to be direct due to fractionation processes during initial pyrolysis and subsequent transport (Saiz et al., 2015). Phytoliths Phytoliths are silica bodies that form in living plants. Since different plant species produce different phytolith morphotypes, phytoliths can be used to identify plant assemblages and thereby to study palaeovegetation. Phytoliths have been increasingly used in plant palaeoecology studies because of their potential to elucidate changes in vegetation patterns, represent local vegetation growth because of their resistance to degradation under tropical environmental conditions that are not favorable for pollen preservation (Rashid et al., 2019; Testé et al., 2020). Phytolith analysis is therefore used to identify the past vegetation communities in a particular landscape. The analysis relies on morphotype counts and the delineation of classes of morphotypes that are indicative of plant groups. Multiplicity and redundancy are two of the main limitations of phytolith analyses. Multiplicity refers to the production of range of different morphotypes by each plant, as deposition of silica often occurs at several sites in the plant tissue. Furthermore, redundancy refers to the overlap in the shapes of the silica bodies formed inside plants, even between taxa that are not closely related. Additionally, phytoliths are biased against non-grasses in many ecosystems. Although multiplicity and redundancy in phytoliths can limit the vegetation inferences in detail, some morphotypes can be still ascribed to certain plant groups (Daniau et al., 2019; Neumann et al., 2019): Poaceae (saddle, bilobate, trapezoid oblong, elongate), Poaceae/Cyperaceae (bulliform, cuneiform bulliform, elongate entire cylindrical, elongate psilate, elongate blocky, elongate rugose, elogate facetated, blocky), woody dicotyledons (globular psilate) and non-diagnostic. According to Strömberg et al. (2018), vegetation inferences are statistically robust for assemblages with a clearly skewed morphotype distribution. For example, 90% woody dicotyledons phytoliths vs. 10% Poaceae phytoliths. While pioneer studies using phytoliths targeted the development of agriculture and dietary practices in archaeological contexts (e.g. Piperno et al., 1991; Kealhofer and Piperno, 1998), phytolith analysis has been increasingly used in plant paleoecology studies because of its potential to identify past changes in vegetation patterns. In the tropics at least, this is because they represent local vegetation and are more resistant to degradation under environmental conditions that are not favorable for the preservation of other plant proxies such as pollen (Rashid et al., 2019; Testé et al., 2020). Despite their long history of use internationally, the application of phytoliths in Australian palaeoecology remains limited to a handful of studies in the Australian tropics (Wallis, 2003, 2001), and their potential utility remains largely unexploited. 2.5 Chapter 2 summary Sanamere Lagoon is located in the dry tropics of northern Australia, where monsoon dynamics, modulated by phenomena such as ENSO is currently the main determinant of climate. Previous studies report significant changes in geography (sea level, shoreline. dune activity) that influenced climate in the past. Although several studies have provided results on past environmental change in the tropics of Australia, no records older than 8 ka are available for Cape York Peninsula. This thesis uses a multiproxy approach to contribute to fill the gaps associated with the past hydrology, vegetation and fire at Sanamere Lagoon, including elemental, isotopic (\\(\\delta\\)13C and \\(\\delta\\)15N), diatom, phytolith and pyrogenic carbon (Hypy fraction) analyses. Additionally, this thesis builds a reliable chronology for the Sanamere Lagoon sediment core by analysing and comparing the radiocarbon results from six different carbon fractions.
