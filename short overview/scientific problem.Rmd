# Statement of the problem

.pull-left[

Future climate projections require past data to feed models.

*But*

There is a lack of information about past climate and environmental change in northern Australia

# Design a solution


1. Obtain ages for the sediments - Subproject 1

2. Identify and delineate periods of change - Subproject 2

## Find environmental and climate changes across time

## Hierarchical clustering and PC to delineate periods of change


- Four main periods of environmental change were identified (33 - 29.1 ka, 29.1 - 18.2 ka, 18.2 - 9.7 ka and 9.7 ka - present).

- Regional climatic events, such as the reactivation of the monsoon and sea level rise are reflected in the local ecosystems along a diversity of biogeochemical responses.
