# PhD_Final

This repo contains source files for my PhD thesis titled, "Multi-proxy evidence for long environmental change in northern Australia's tropical savannas", at James Cook University. Further information and metadata can be accessed at www.research.jcu.edu.au

The datasets are from biological and chemical indicators measured in a sediment core. I integrated the information from all different indicators using several statistical techniques, including hierarchical cluster, principal component analysis, regression, and time series analysis. I performed the data cleaning, wrangling, manipulation, analysis, and visualisation of a dataset with over 3,000 observations from more than 35 variables.

The folder 'experiments' contains the raw data associated with each indicator used.
The folder 'preprocessing' contains the cleaning and wrangling of each dataset.
Thr folder 'processed_data' contails
