# Reconstructing the last 30,000 years of environmental history in the savannas of Northern Australia

This repo contains source files for my PhD thesis titled, "Multi-proxy evidence for long environmental change in northern Australia's tropical savannas", at James Cook University. Further information can be accessed at https://research.jcu.edu.au/. DOI number is in progress.

The thesis followed the FAIR data principles and metadata was created according to the National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/cvterms?termId=0. 

The datasets are from biological and chemical indicators measured in a sediment core. I integrated the information from all different indicators using several statistical techniques, including hierarchical cluster, principal component analysis, regression, and time series analysis. I performed the data cleaning, wrangling, manipulation, analysis, and visualisation of a dataset with over 3,000 observations from more than 35 variables.

The Rmd files in the main directory are the first four chapters of the thesis and show the code used to write them.
